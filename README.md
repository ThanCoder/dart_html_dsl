**dart_html_dsl** is a type-safe Dart DSL for building HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
using pure Dart code.

It allows you to define web UI elements, scoped styles, pseudo-classes
(e.g. `:hover`, `:active`), and JavaScript event bindings in a structured,
Flutter-inspired, component-based way — without writing raw HTML, CSS, or JS.

This package is designed for developers who want full control over web output
while keeping everything in Dart.
